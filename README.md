### EBay-Motors-sighting

The purpose of this project is to find vintage motorcycles, for example, BSA, Triumph, Norton, BMW... and 
record basic information lik, VIN, model, year, price....

The goal is to make this flexable for any other such search.

#### How it works.
1. Enter a search, for example "BSA" 1960-1970
2. Parses each result and saves to a db
3. Can export from DB to CSV
4. Will be able to add results "sightings" to https://github.com/Heteroskedastic/Classic-Motorcycles

Uses:
* flask
* https://github.com/timotheus/ebaysdk-python
